Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning A supervised machine learning project that predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on diagnostic measurements from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.  
This project was developed independently by two students from different colleges as part of their AI/ML learning portfolio. The goal is to apply real-world machine learning workflows in the healthcare domain using Python and scikit-learn.

Dataset Used:
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

569 samples, 30 numerical features

Features include: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, symmetry, etc.

Project Highlights:
Data Preprocessing using pandas, NumPy, and StandardScaler

Trained using Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

Predicts whether a tumor is Benign (1) or Malignant (0)

Accepts user input of 30 features for real-time prediction

Displays confidence score of prediction (e.g., 98.5%)

Tools & Technologies:

Python

scikit-learn

pandas, NumPy

matplotlib, seaborn

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Model Performance:

Accuracy: ~96â€“97% on unseen test data

Classifier Used: RandomForestClassifier

Supports live prediction for new inputs from diagnosis reports
